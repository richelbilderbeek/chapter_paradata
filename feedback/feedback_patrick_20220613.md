# Feedback Patrick

I've a had couple of notes on your chapter draft. I shared 1) + 2) in person, 3) + 4) I did not. I've also attached the pdf but that's basically just me making the same comments as below + highlighting interesting parts for me to remember. So not really a need to read it.

On p.4, there's probably a typo: Zenoda should be Zenodo, I think.

1) terminology
1a) usually: experiment -> primary data -> input for data analysis -> the outcome of the data analysis, well

here:
experiment is the data analysis. different. usually involves notion of uncertainty, randomness. most ppl would probably say there should be no randomness in calculating, e.g. a correlation coefficient.

-> led the reader know early in the text and say why you use the terminology the way you do, or what's gained from taking or your perspective.
not saying it's wrong!
just to safeguard against a reader going off on the wrong track. your title - that I like! - might feel provocative to some, so installing some safety measures might be worth considering. ;)


1b) data as an umbrella term (primary/raw data, paradata, metadata, etc.) vs data as synonym for primary data.

2) paper is more than a verbal presentation of the output of data analysis, i.e. more than writing down statistics.
It should discuss it, interpret it, put into context, discuss limitations, offer an outlook.
also discusses background to the code: version of R, packages, which computer OS, and so on.
All this is hardly to not at all part of the code. Maybe a bit in the form of #comments.
A good empirical paper should also discuss the choices that were made, and why they were made.

thus the paper provides more to the scientific community than (just re-executing) the code (would).

Reproducibility and related topics are very important to me and appear to gain steam in the scientific communities, with psychology probably being the furthest along. Thus, I really like that this part of the edited volume. (A similar point can be made for "Fairness in AI/Algorithms/algorthmic decision making", studied in ch. 10 + 13.)
So maybe your chapter also has this great teachable moment opportunity. Two things I thought about in this regard.
3) Paper and code need not be separated. RMarkdown is an option where code chunks and paper text (tex, word, etc.) are in the same file. In theory, this might be the best option. In practice, to be honest, I myself find it difficult to change my current workflow from TeX + R to RMarkdown.
4) It might be worth sharing a best practice suggestion with the reader. This strikes me as a good suggestion, but have no way of knowing whether something better is out there. https://twitter.com/ikashnitsky/status/1375575558730493952 .
