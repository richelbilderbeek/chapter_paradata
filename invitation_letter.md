Invitation to edited volume: Perspectives to Paradata

We are planning a multi-disciplinary edited volume, preliminarily titled “Perspectives to
Paradata - Research and Practices of Documenting Data Processes”, on documentation of
data making processes. We have found your work on [insert here specification] exciting and
relevant to the topic, and wonder if you would be interested in contributing? Your chapter
would make up a key component in a set of case studies. The aim of the volume is to
provide a cross-disciplinary run-through of perspectives to the phenomenon and concept of
paradata. With paradata we mean data that describes processes (appr. as in Couper, 2000,
cf. metadata that describes data Pomerantz, 2015).
In order to achieve cohesion while maintaining complexity and specificity across the
volume’s contributions, we are asking all authors to use the following steps to guide the work
with individual chapters:
1. Take a starting point in a data making effort that you have studied or have experience
with. In your case that could relate to [something the person knows about].
2. Describe the method for process description and any documentation that was
created as a part of this process description. Excerpts, figures, tables, or imagery can
be used to underline main points or aspects of the process description and
documentation (or the lack thereof).
3. Discuss the different uses and significance(s) of the process description and
documentation in its setting of creation and potential data-reuse scenarios.
4. Use as you see fit the notion of paradata to discuss the process description and
documentation. The notion of paradata can be used to e.g., to highlight certain
aspects of the process description and documentation or its use(s); to establish
relationships or fault lines between the process documentation and other data
categories; to put into focus the tasks and workflows involved in creating the process
documentation.
Approximate chapter length 5 000 words + references. Details will follow.
We are currently negotiating to have the volume published in the International Association
for Knowledge Management IAKM book series “Knowledge Management and Organizational
Learning”, published by Springer. The volume will be published in Open Access. The book
processing charge will be covered by the CAPTURE project (funded by the European
Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation
programme grant agreement No 818210).
We are more than happy to discuss details of your possible contribution and answer any
questions you might have. If you would like to co-author your chapter together with a
colleague, you are welcome to do so. Just let us know the co-author or co-authors of your
choice.
We are looking forward to receiving your expression of interest at your earliest convenience.Approximate submissions timeline
