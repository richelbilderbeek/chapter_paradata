\begin{abstract}

Here we define paradata as the data that describes the generation of data.
In genetic epidemiology, the data generated is mostly the results 
of an analysis (e.g. predicting a person having a disease),
as done by computer code.
In such context, paradata is usually the scientific paper that
describes what the computer code does.
However, this has the unrealtistic 
assumption that there is a perfect match between the paper and the code.
In this chapter it is argued that the source code should should be supplied,
as this is the true paradata: if the paper and code disagree, it is the
code that has generated the results.
The chapter concludes by some rules how to better code to serve as paradata,
and hence allowing computational research to be truly reproducible.

\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% This section has paragraph headers. This helps me, the author,
% to focus the contents of my paragraphs.
% In the final version of this manuscript, these will be removed.

% \paragraph{Universities produce knowledge}

The currency that universities generate is knowledge, which in turn is distributed
in mostly lectures and academic papers.
Academic papers contain knowledge, either as the
report of measurements or the outcome of an experiment.
These reports are described in English, the current lingua franca of science.

% \paragraph{A paper contains data and should be FAIR data}

A paper contains and/or describes data, where we define
data as 'individual facts, statistics, or items of information, often 
numeric' \cite{glossary2003oecd}.
To ensure unhampered knowledge growth, this data should [TODO: Why? Reference!] 
follow the FAIR 
principles.
The FAIR principles \cite{wilkinson2016fair} are that data should be 
[TODO: there are probably better examples]
Findable (e.g. found by web),
Accessible (e.g. DataDryad and or Zenoda), 
Interoperable (e.g. comma-separated files) 
and Reusable (e.g. work on all operating systems)

% \paragraph{A paper is data and should be FAIR data}

A paper in itself is data, as it is a collection of text and
figures that we itself can do measurements upon.
Also here, a paper should be FAIR, 
[TODO: there are probably better examples]
i.e.
Findable (e.g. Google Scholar)
Accessible (e.g. view it online), 
Interoperable (e.g. written in English)
and Reusable (e.g. it is valid to cite and build upon earlier academic papers).
This paper itself will later specify the standpoint that a paper
is metadata (i.e. data about data), instead of paradata (i.e.
data that describes the collection of data)

% \paragraph{For some fields, the experiment is actually run by code}

This paper focusses on research fields that uses computation
to do experiments and uses genetic epidemiology as an example.
Genetic epidemiology is a field within biology that, among 
others, measures the spread (hence 'epidemiology') 
of heritable (i.e. genetic) traits, as well as the relation
between having a certain genetic makeup and a certain trait,
where the trait can be any human property, such as weight, height,
the amount of metabolites and having a disease yes/no.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Example study}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

    the village where the Northern Swedish Population
    Health Study started.

  }
  \label{fig:karesuando_church}
\end{figure}

As an example, we'll use a pseudorandomly selected paper
from \cite{ahsan2017relative}. The data used by that paper is
from a population study called the Northern Swedish Population
Health Study (NSPHS) that started in 2010 \cite{igl2010northern}. 
The approximately 1000 participants were initially mostly surveyed
about lifestyle \cite{igl2010northern} and follow-up studies
provided the type of data relevant for this paper, 
which are (1) the genetic data \cite{johansson2013identification},
(2) the concentration of certain proteins in the 
blood \cite{enroth2014strong,enroth2015effect}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{1189px-Eukaryote_DNA-en.png}
  \caption{
    A cell has a nucleus that contains chromosomes. 
    Each of these chromosomes (46 in humans) consist out of DNA.

    with the colors red, yellow, green and blue.
    From \cite{sponk2012}
  }
  \label{fig:eukakyote_dna}
\end{figure}

The first type of data, the (final form of the) genetic data,
consists out of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
SNPs consist out of a name, a position and a nucleotide. 
DNA (organized into chromosomes and present in every (nucleated) cell, 
see figure \ref{fig:eukakyote_dna}) consists out of many nucleotides, of which there are four types,
called adenosine, cytosine, guanine and thyrosine, all commonly abreviated
as A, C, G and T respectively.
One SNP example is \verb|rs12133641|, which is a SNP located at position 
154,428,283,
where some people have a certain nucleotide. In this case, 
67 percent of the people within this study have an A,
and 33 percent have a G (also from \cite{ahsan2017relative}, Table S3).

    of proteins produced (not shown in figure).

  }
  \label{fig:dna_to_protein}
\end{figure}

The second type of data are concentrations of certain proteins in the 
blood. DNA contains the code for building proteins (see Figure 
\ref{fig:dna_to_protein}), 
as well as the rate
at which a protein is created. Some proteins end up in the blood and
their presence can be used to assess the health of an individual.
IL6RA is a protein [TODO: more info]

The field of genetic epidemiology looks -among others- for
correlations between genetic data and biological traits.
For example, figure \ref{fig:ahsan2017relative_table_2_sub} (from \cite{ahsan2017relative}) shows that
SNP \verb|rs12133641| is highly correlated (p value is 3.0 * 10e-73, 
961 individuals) with protein IL6RA. What this results does
not yet teach us, is how this correlation works, yet
figure \ref{fig:ahsan2017relative_s6} shows us the direction of the association:
the X axis shows the possible genetic make-ups (aka the genotype) of the individuals,
where 0 denotes the individuals with genotype
AA (the individual inherited one adenosine 
from his/here mother and one adenosine from his/her father), 
1.0 denotes AG (one A is inherited from one parent, 
where the G is inherited from the other parent) and 2.0 denotes GG.
From Figure \ref{fig:ahsan2017relative_s6} we can conclude that, on average,
the more guanines are inherited at that SNPs location,
the higher concentration of IL6RA can be found in a human's blood.

The amount of variance that can be explained by an association (i.e.
the R squared value) is rarely 100 percent, which means that a trait (in
this case, IL6RA concentrations) cannot be perfectly explained
from the genotype alone. As we can see in figure \ref{fig:ahsan2017relative_s6}, 
43 percent of the variance can be attributed to an individuals'
genotype and additional factors, 
such as the effect
of the environment (e.g. geographic location, time of day), 
lifestyle (e.g. smoking yes/no) or having a disease (e.g. diabetes) 
are needed to explain the variation between individuals better.

    961 individuals) to the concentration of the protein IL6RA, as measured
    in blood. The table is a simplified result from \cite{ahsan2017relative}.

\section{Code is more important than the (English) paper}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% \paragraph{The experiments within genetic epidemology works are done by code}

The experiment described above is run by code. There is no fieldwork,
nor lab-work involved. It is the researcher that writes the code,
after which the code does the work. A genetic epidemiologist that
looks for associations between genotype and phenotype,
one does not need a lab.

To \emph{obtain} the genetic data, yes, there may be fieldwork and/or lab-work
involved. For example, a researcher needs to go into the field to take
samples (e.g. blood) of humans or other species. To analyse these samples,
a researcher needs a lab. Depending on the technique being used on
how to analyse the samples, there may be a big bioinformatics step
to aggregate the measurements into useful genetic data. 
Although this paper does not focus on the code run to 
aggragate the raw data into useful genetic data, the same arguments
can be made for that code as in the example: that code is 
the ground truth of how the raw data is collected into useful genetic data.

% \paragraph{The code is the paradata for the results of an experiment}

Programming code is paradata, as it is data that describes how data is collected,
which is the definition of paradata [TODO: REF].
Programming code is data that is usually in the form of text, 
spread over one or more files, that describes the experiment.
The experiment collects the data.
The data collected is the data we call the results of an experiment.

The article is metadata, as it is data that describes other
data, which is the definition of metadata [TODO: REF]:
an article describes the
experiment and hence the programming
code in English. However, it is not the best
candidate to describe how the data is collected,
as it has a loose connection with collecting the data.
Again, if the code and article of an experiment disagree,
it is the code that actually let the data be collected.  
Instead, an article is metadata about a research.

% \paragraph{Science should be reproducible}

A scientific claim must be reproducible before it is accepted
by the scientific community.
Reproducibility (i.e. to reproduce the same results) 
and replicability (i.e. to reconclude a conclusion)
are fundamental characteristics of scientific studies (\cite{patil2019visual}).
For computational science, it is relatively easy to 
reproduce an experiment, as all it takes is a computer, electricity,
an optional internet connection, the code and the data.
In computational science, however, it appears that 
culture to reproduce results has been lost 
and to counter this, it has been suggested to make
reproducible research a minimal requirement for 
publication (\cite{peng2011reproducible}).

% \paragraph{Code should be published}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{peng2011reproducible_fig_1.png}
  \caption{
    Levels of reproducibility, from \cite{peng2011reproducible}
  }
  \label{fig:peng2011reproducible}
\end{figure}

The code of a computational experiment must be published
for an experiment to reproducible.
It is however (too) common that the original data
and/or code are unavailable (\cite{peng2021reproducible}).
One sad example is described in \cite{haibe2020importance}, where
an algorithm that detects breast cancer better than a human expert,
was irreproducible.
In the case of genetic epidemiology, it is a given that the original
data cannot be published as this data is sensitive.
The code of a computational experiment, however, can be
distributed without such problems.
It is, however, not code that is published, but an English
description of what that code does instead.
From a knowledge management's perspective,
to conserve an experiment,
it is the code that must be archived and not the
English description of what it does:
it is the code does the actual work.
Hence, from a knowledge management perspective, emphasis should be
put more on the preservation of code, as it is the most important actor
in an experiment.

% \paragraph{Example of code being the ground truth}

Code should be published, as it holds the
ground truth of an experiment; it does the actual work.
The more complex the computation pipeline is, the easier it is
to have a mismatch between the article (that describes what the
code does) and the code (that actually does the work).
It is easy (tempting?) to overlook how easy it is to have a mismatch
between paper and code.

To illustrate how easy it is to get a mismatch between a paper
and the code, consider this fictional example
of a text in a paper:

\begin{verbatim}
We compared the values of x and y using a one-tailed Student's T-test,
as we expect the average value of x to be less than the average value of y.
\end{verbatim}

We ignore the choices of words and style of this sentence: what is
important is the content: a one-tailed T test is performed.
Taking a look at the (in this case, the programming language R) code, 
we find the following line:

\begin{verbatim}
t.test(x, y)
\end{verbatim}

The line of code is simplified (as the result of the T test is never stored),
but the code is correct:
\verb|t.test| is indeed the name of an R function to do a T-test
and it is reasonable to assume that this code, when found in the code
of an article, is assumed to be correct.

Here, however, we see a mismatch between the English description and the code:
by default, the R function \verb|t.test| does a \textbf{two}-tailed T-test.
A consequence of this fictional example is that the published p-values are
higher than needed, resulting in less significant findings, which
results in less conclusions drawn from a paper.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{baggerly2009deriving_fig_1a.png}
  \caption{
    Gene expression result due to an off-by-one error.
    The cells in the main table show how much mRNA is produced per cell 
    line (the columns) for different proteins (the rows).
    The colors above the cells, with the dendrogram, shows
    red for cells that do not respond (red) and do respond (blue) to an 
    antibiotic.
    The purple rectangles show samples that are duplicated.
    Note that, due to this, some
    samples that behave identically are both non-responders and responders.
    From \cite{baggerly2009deriving}
  }
  \label{fig:baggerly2009deriving}
\end{figure}

It is the paper that accompanies the code,
as it is the code that generates the results.
When humans are fallible and code gets bigger, the likelihood of
a mismatch between the English paper and the code increases.
We know that the most common errors are 
simple (and may legitimately fear that those simple errors are common) 
(\cite{baggerly2009deriving}),
and this example is not too far off from the
examples given in that paper.

But regardless of the size of the code, 
it is the code that is the ground truth.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{There are multiple way to publish code}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

There are multiple ways of publishing code,
that are increasingly hard to do, yet result
in more reproducible experiments:
(1) publishing the code as text only, e.g. by printing
it in a Supplementary Materials, (2) publishing
the code on a hosted website, e.g on GitHub, with
added features (3) publishing 
the installed code within a virtual environment,
for example, using a Singularity container.
Here I will go into details of each of these ways.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Publishing raw code}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Code is commonly published alongside of a 
paper, pasted as text in the Supplementary Materials 
(for example, in \cite{labrecque2019interpretation}).
This is the rawest form of publishing code,
as it is just text.

% \paragraph{Raw code is important}

The raw code of a computational experiment is
more important to preserve than the article describing
the experiment, even when both describe the experiment identically,
correctly and reproducibly, 
as it has/should been that code that generated the results of an experiment.
Again: if the paper and code differ, it is the code that did
the actual work with the actual/true results.

% \paragraph{Raw code is an indicator of quality}

Raw code gives an indication of the quality 
of a computational experiment and several metrics are
devised to get an idea of the quality of code.

The simplest metric to assess the quality of code is 
the amount of (single) lines of code (SLOC). 
Code that has a lower SLOC count, i.e. it is more concise,
is usually regarded as having a lower chance of containing bugs.
Additionally, following a style guide (e.g. \cite{style_guide}), 
improves software quality (\cite{fang2001}).

A more interesting metric is the cyclomatic complexity of the code.
The cyclomatic complexity is defined as the number of ways that
the code can be executed. 
For example, code that has only one \verb|if| statement
has a cyclomatic complexity of 2, as the condition within the \verb|if|
statement can be true or false.
The cyclomatic complexity correlates with code complexity,
where more complex code is likelier to contain bugs.

A feature that deserves more attention
is that code can actively teach what it does.
A mechanism to do so, which is present in most programming
languages, is error handling: errors are the mechanism
by which a programmer can teach the user what to do/expect.
One example is when calculating the variance of a distribution.
To calculate the variance of a distribution, at least two values
are required. When the variance of only one value is requested,
an error message can helpfully indicate that one needs at least two values.

% \paragraph{The problems with raw code}

There are multiple problems with publishing raw code.
First, there is no guarantee that that code \emph{can} actually
run, for example, due to a typo added after the code was pasted.
Secondly, there is no way to determine if code that worked yesterday
works today. These problems can be prevented by, instead of
pasting raw code, using a website to host that code (see below).

% \paragraph{Raw code is already better than no code}

Publishing raw code is already better than not publishing code at all,
as that raw code can be assumed to have run successfully at least once.
To reproduce an experiment from raw code can be painful, 
yet way better than rewriting the same code from scratch.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Publishing hosted code}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Code is sometimes published alongside a paper, 
in the form of a hosted website.
This way of publishing code gives additional options,
both for the authors of that code, as well as its users.

% \paragraph{Example of hosted code}

There are multiple websites for hosting code, with BitBucket, GitHub,
GitLab and SourceForge being the most well-known.
Of these, GitHub is the most popular website to host code in general,
with millions of users.
GitHub users can create dedicated websites (called 'repositories')
to upload code. GitHub hosts that uploaded by and provides
a user interface for every visiter of such a website.
The use of code hosting websites, such as GitHub,
accommodates collaboration (\cite{perez2016ten}).
\begin{sloppypar}\url{https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/babette},\end{sloppypar}
and improves transparency (\cite{gorgolewski2016practical}).
An example from the author is the website \cite{bbbqarticleissue157},
that hosts part of the code for the paper \cite{bilderbeek2022transmembrane},
as shown in Figure \ref{fig:bbbqarticleissue157}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{bbbq_article_issue_157.png}
  \caption{
    A typical GitHub repository (\cite{bbbqarticleissue157}), 
    hosting the code for a
    computational experiment, 
    as published with \cite{bilderbeek2022transmembrane}.
    Note that this repository has 72 commits, where a commit is a change
    to the code.
  }
  \label{fig:bbbqarticleissue157}
\end{figure}

% \paragraph{Hosted code has important metadata}

Hosted code has many additional features, such as
a version-controlled history, continuous integration scripts
and automatically generated metrics.

% \paragraph{Hosted code has a commit history}

Hosted code commonly has a commit history. For example, GitHub
uses a version control system called \verb|git| (hence its name).
In practice, this means that when a change is made to the code,
a new version is created. In the case that the change was harmful,
one can go back to an earlier version and continue again from there.

% \paragraph{A commit history helps assess honest reporting}

Hosted code improves transparency (\cite{gorgolewski2016practical}).
The history of changes, called the commit history, 
helps to assess the honesty in the reporting of the code. 
Ideally, the full version history of the code 
has been generated, by hosting the code directly at its inception.
However, in some repositories, only the final version of the code has been
posted, which means all historical information is lost.
From a code history, it can be observed, for example, 
how much statistical tests have really/actually been done 
and see if all are reported:
not reporting a statistical tests is considered a Dubious Research Practice 
\richel{REF}, as this allows dishonest reporting of p-value hacking.

% \paragraph{Continuous integration helps assess code quality}

Some code hosts, among others, GitHub, 
allows the researcher to start software scripts when uploading a new version.
To determine the reproducibility of the code, one such script should
run the code (on trivial data) to verify if the code works at all.
If the functionality of the code is lost, the researcher
can immediatly see which small change was the cause of this.
A formalized version of this workflow is called continuous integration (CI).
Using a CI service (such as GitHub Actions), is known to significantly 
increase the number of bugs exposed (\cite{vasilescu2015}) and increases
the speed at which new features are added (\cite{vasilescu2015}).
Using CI opens up the possibility to informally annotate features of
a repository. For example, Figure \ref{fig:build_badge} shows a 
build badge that indicates that a LaTeX document (i.e. this paper)
could be built.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{build_badge.png}
  \caption{
    A build badge for the GitHub repository of this article.
    The description indicates which process it is that the badge
    signals success (as in this case) or failure of. 
  }
  \label{fig:build_badge}
\end{figure}

% \paragraph{Code coverage helps assess code quality}

A more sophisticated check for the code's correctness is
to run units tests and determine the percentage of code that has been
tested, which is called the code coverage. Code coverage
correlates with code quality (\cite{horgan1994,del1995correlation}). 
The non-profit organisation rOpenSci, which peer-reviews code,
has made it a prerequisite to have a code coverage of 100\%.
Also here, CI opens up the possibility to informally annotate the
code coverage. For example, Figure \ref{fig:badge_codecov} shows a 
build badge that indicates that certain R package's code 
has a 100\% code coverage.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[]{badge_codecov.png}
  \caption{
    A build badge for the code coverage of an R 
    package (\url{https://github.com/ropensci/beautier}).
    The umbrella signals that the code coverage is hosted by
    CodeCov (\url{https://codecov.io/}). 
    The text indicates which process it is that the badge
    signals, which in this case, is that the code is fully covered
    by tests.
  }
  \label{fig:badge_codecov}
\end{figure}

% \paragraph{Metrics help assess the honest division of labour}

Most code hosts, among others, GitHub and GitLab,
automatically keep track of certain metrics.
One such metric is the amount of code each contributor has made.
In that way, authors involved in the writing of the software
are honestly acknowledged. Figure \ref{fig:daisie_contributors}
shows the number of commits the authors of DAISIE (\cite{etienne2020daisie})
have made to its code.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{daisie_contributors.png}
  \caption{
    An overview of the commits that multiple contributors have
    made, in this case, to the code of DAISIE (\cite{etienne2020daisie})
  }
  \label{fig:daisie_contributors}
\end{figure}


% \paragraph{A reader can contact the author}

A feature that gets too few attention is that code hosts
allow users to post bug reports and/or ask questions.
This allows other researchers to assess the health
of the code.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{issue_ldpred2.png}
  \caption{
    An overview of the issues for the code for
    LDpred2 (\cite{prive2020ldpred2}). Of the 310 issues, 300 have been closed.
    The first four issues have been replied to, as indicated by the
    talk balloon. The fifth issues has a label with the text 'feature request'
    to signal the issue type.
  }
  \label{fig:issue_ldpred2}
\end{figure}

% \paragraph{The problems with hosted code}

Albeith hosted code is vastly superior over raw code
in case of reproduciblity and correctness,
there are some problems with hosted code as well.
The most important one is that hosted code needs maintanance:
the libraries that are used by an experiment
will change over time, inevitably causing the experiment to fail
over time. This process is called bit rot and is a fundamental
problem \richel{ref}. A solution that has more 
longevity is to publishing the code installed in a virtual environment,
as described below.

A lesser problem, which is only a problem to some, is, that
the author of the code can be contacted and that bugs can be reported.
It can be argued that no energy should be wasted on published code.
This is however, a rather selfish point: a bug should be reported and
given proper attention, for the sake of the correctness of the 
results published. 

% \paragraph{Suggestions for knowledge management}

Here are multiple suggestions to make hosted code FAIR.
To make the hosted code findable, commonly a paper refers to its URL.
At the homepage of hosted code, there is no standardized metadata, to,
for example, link to the paper.
Using a popular code host ensures the code is easily accessible.
There is some interoperabily supplied by a version control manager,
such as in obtaining the history of the code.
The reusability of code is reasonably easy to assess, by using build badges.
However, there is no guarantee that a build badge that claimes success,
actually is an honest signal (i.e. that code may not actually build),
nor are there standards for what 'success' entails.

\subsection{Publishing a virtual environment}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The most reproducible way of submitting the code of an experiment,
is by providing the code and all it needs 
installed in a virtual container.
This is close to the golden standard suggested by 
\cite{peng2011reproducible} (see also Figure \ref{fig:peng2011reproducible}),
however, that was before virtualization existed.
Virtualization allows one to provide a standard environment,
that can be used on any other computer.
The best known examples of container software are Docker and Singularity,
where the latter is the only viable option to be able to run
an experiment on a high performance computing (HPC) environment,
such as a computer cluster.

% \paragraph{Containers allow for runnable code, for longer periods of time}

Unlike English, code is fragile in standing the test of time.
Containers can alleviate this, as these can be created at a point
in time and then run later. Because the container is stand-alone,
all libraries the code depends on remain in their current/old state.
As with hosted code, an experiment may not run with newer versions
of libraries anymore, but a containerized experiment can run regardless, if
one refrains from updating.

Ideally, to re-do an experiment, one would need a one-liner to a container,
for example, \verb|singularity run my_experiment.sif run|.

% \paragraph{Runnable code can precisely reproduce an experiment}

Containers allow a computation experiment to be highly reproducible:
given the same data, an experiment put into a container will give
the same results on different platforms, at least in theory.
In practice, differences may be observed when peripheral factors
are different, such as the random numbers as generated by an operating
system, or data that is downloaded from additional online sources.

% \paragraph{Runnable code allows others to re-use an experiment}

Containers allow a computation experiment to be highly re-usable,
as any scientist can work with it and tweak code.

% \paragraph{The problems with runnable code}

There are some problems with providing a container with a runnable container.
First, a container is several gigabytes and need to be stored somewhere
online. Ideally, this would be at Syslabs, as that one is free, yet
there is a limit of 15 Gb. Also, Sylabs does not allow much metadata to
be entered, such as the URL of the article, nor the URL of hosted code.
Also, journals do not request hosted code, nor runnable code.

% \paragraph{Suggestions for knowledge management}

Here are multiple suggestions to make containers with runnable code FAIR.
To make such containers findable, the most common 
environments (Syslabs and DockerHub) to upload containers must be indexed.
Uploading a container to those environments is, however, limited by
a restricted amount of free storage, with the possible consequence that
those containers are uploaded somewhere where they escape proper indexing.
Having containers uploaded at the existing websites ensures they are
accessible, interoperable and reusable.
One could argue however, that the scientific community need its own,
similar website to upload containers, as the metadata for these
sites are limited to free-text comments and tags (DockerHub)
or not metadata at all (Syslabs).

% \paragraph{Runnable code is the pinnacle of reproducible research}

When research truly needs to be reproducible, putting the code 
of an experiment into a container is a good solution, as it 
can stand the test of time well. Rewarding this, however, is not
done yet by journals.

\section{Conclusions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The code that does the work in a computational experiment should
always be published together with a scholarly article.
For research to be reproducible, one ideally has access to
both the data used and the code.
In some fields, such as genetic epidemiology, the data is
sensitive, hence cannot be released,
yet there are methods being devised to run code on sensitive
data with assured privacy \cite{zhang2016review,azencott2018machine}.

Code has additional useful information, similar to confidence intervals,
that allow a reader to gauge how much he/she trusts the results.
The most important way to determine the quality of code
is the amount of unit tests.
When following a set of best practices, such as DevOps, TDD, Agile,
writing unit tests is an essential 
part in writing code.
The amount of unit tests is an honest signal 
for code correctness (i.e. it does what it is supposed to do, as opposed
to 'it does something').
In academia, to uncover the truth, code correctness is essential.
To make a comparison with cell biologists, where working
sterile is essential to have the correct results,
unit tests allow a computational biologist to have the same.

Code is harder to preserve than an English text.

Although code is the primary actor in computational experiments,
there is no incentive to submit code alongside a publication.
Most academic journal do not require authors to submit their code,
nor it the submitted code peer reviewed.

Although the code of computation experiments can be archived well, 
there is no incentive to do so.

Although a runnable version of a computation experiment can be archived well, 
there is no incentive to do so.

\section{Discussion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% \paragraph{Definition of paradata}

Code may or may not be paradata, depending on how the definition
is interpreted.
Here we repeat the definition of 'paradata' and discuss 
its (numbered) constituents.
This paper defined paradata as 'data (1) about the collecting (2) of the data (3)',
where (1) code must be seen as data, (2) downloading raw data
and doing calculations must be seen as collecting, and (3) the
results of an experiment must be seen as data.
This paper argues, that (1) code is data in the form of text spread
over one or more files, that has useful measurable properties, 
(2) downloading raw datas and doing calculations, such as a T-test,
does describe how the bits and pieces of an end result is collected,
and (3) an experimental results is data, as it can be measured and
used as the raw data of a next experiment.

% \paragraph{The drawbacks of publishing code}

Publishing code may be disadvantageous for an author.
For science, yes, as this allows reproducible research.
For an author, publishing code alongside an experiment opens up
the possibily to receive questions regarding that code.
Note, however, that not publishing code will always thwart
the reproduction of incorrect code, at the cost of a scientific
career \cite{baggerly2009deriving}.

% \paragraph{The drawbacks of publishing version-controlled code}

Is it worth it to publish version-controlled code?
For an author, 
there is additional training involved, and also here,
publishing code alongside an experiment opens up
the possibily to receive questions regarding that code.

% \paragraph{The drawbacks of publishing a running version of code}

Is it worth it to archive running versions of code?
For an author, 
there is additional training involved.
There is no FAIR infrastructure for Singularity containers.

% \paragraph{Still need the same data to do a reproducible experiment}

% \paragraph{Recommendations}

Being able to re-do an experiment is a core principle of the scientific method.
Publishing only a paper about a computational experiment is not enough,
as the results are too likely to mismatch that English description.
Journal should make it mandatory for authors
to publish their code alongside a computational experiment.
Authors should follow the FAIR principes for their code as well,
as can be done using the infrastructure as supplied by, 
for example, GitHub and GitLab, opening up new angles in
metascience regarding computational experiments.
Knowledge managers should create the infrastructure for the preservation
of runnable experiments, to allow scientist to upload a Singularity
container, so these are as well following the FAIR principles.

                  & Website to host containers must allow for annotation \\
                  & Use a standarized badge for the container to be functioning  \\
                  & Standarize to link between container, paper and code repository \\

% \paragraph{Final word}

The world of science would be a more open, humble, trustworthy, truthful
and helpful would the code that accompanies a scientific paper
be treated like a first class citizen. As doing so in an exemplary way
in yet to be rewarded, hence it has to be the idealististic scientists
to wage this battle. I feel the truth and science are worth fighting for
and I hope this paper helps others to join.
