\begin{abstract}

Here we define paradata as the data that describes the generation of data.
In genetic epidemiology, the data generated is mostly the results 
of an analysis (e.g. predicting a person having a disease),
as done by computer code.
In such context, paradata is usually the scientific paper that
describes what the computer code does.
However, this has the unrealtistic 
assumption that there is a perfect match between the paper and the code.
In this chapter it is argued that the source code should should be supplied,
as this is the true paradata: if the paper and code disagree, it is the
code that has generated the results.
The chapter concludes by some rules how to allow code to serve as paradata,
and hence allowing computational research to be truly reproducible.

\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% This section has paragraph headers. This helps me, the author,
% to focus the contents of my paragraphs.
% In the final version of this manuscript, these will be removed.

\paragraph{Universities produce knowledge}

The currency that universities generate is knowledge, which in turn is distributed
in mostly lectures and academic papers.
Academic papers contain knowledge, either as the
report of measurements or the outcome of an experiment.
These reports are described in English, the current lingua franca of science.

\paragraph{A paper contains data and should be FAIR data}

A paper contains and/or describes data, where we define
data as 'individual facts, statistics, or items of information, often 
numeric' \cite{glossary2003oecd}.
To ensure unhampered knowledge growth, this data should [TODO: Why? Reference!] 
follow the FAIR 
principles.
The FAIR principles \cite{wilkinson2016fair} are that data should be 
[TODO: there are probably better examples]
Findable (e.g. found by web),
Accessible (e.g. DataDryad and or Zenoda), 
Interoperable (e.g. comma-separated files) 
and Reusable (e.g. work on all operating systems)

\paragraph{A paper is data and should be FAIR data}

A paper in itself is data, as it is a collection of text and
figures that we itself can do measurements upon.
Also here, a paper should be FAIR, 
[TODO: there are probably better examples]
i.e.
Findable (e.g. Google Scholar)
Accessible (e.g. view it online), 
Interoperable (e.g. written in English)
and Reusable (e.g. it is valid to cite and build upon earlier academic papers).
This paper itself will later specify the standpoint that a paper
is metadata (i.e. data about data), instead of paradata (i.e.
data that describes the collection of data)

\paragraph{For some fields, the experiment is actually run by code}

This paper focusses on research fields that uses computation
to do experiments and uses genetic epidemiology as an example.
Genetic epidemiology is a field within biology that, among 
others, measures the spread (hence 'epidemiology') 
of heritable (i.e. genetic) traits, as well as the relation
between having a certain genetic makeup and a certain trait,
where the trait can be any human property, such as weight, height,
the amount of metabolites and having a disease yes/no.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Example study}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Karesuando_church.jpg}
  \caption{

    the village where the Northern Swedish Population
    Health Study started.
    From \cite{hopfner2005}
  }
  \label{fig:karesuando_church}
\end{figure}

As an example, we'll use a pseudorandomly selected paper
from \cite{ahsan2017relative}. The data used by that paper is
from a population study called the Northern Swedish Population
Health Study (NSPHS) that started in 2010 \cite{igl2010northern}. 
The approximately 1000 participants were initially mostly surveyed
about lifestyle \cite{igl2010northern} and follow-up studies
provided the type of data relevant for this paper, 
which are (1) the genetic data \cite{johansson2013identification},
(2) the concentration of certain proteins in the 
blood \cite{enroth2014strong,enroth2015effect}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{1189px-Eukaryote_DNA-en.png}
  \caption{
    A cell has a nucleus that contains chromosomes. 
    Each of these chromosomes (46 in humans) consist out of DNA. 
    DNA itself conists out of 4 nucleotides, 
    as depicted by the horizontal sticks 
    with the colors red, yellow, green and blue.
    From \cite{sponk2012}
  }
  \label{fig:eukakyote_dna}
\end{figure}

The first type of data, the (final form of the) genetic data,
consists out of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
SNPs consist out of a name, a position and a nucleotide. 
DNA (organized into chromosomes and present in every (nucleated) cell, 
see figure \ref{fig:eukakyote_dna}) consists out of many nucleotides, of which there are four types,
called adenosine, cytosine, guanine and thyrosine, all commonly abreviated
as A, C, G and T respectively.
One SNP example is \verb|rs12133641|, which is a SNP located at position 
154,428,283,
where some people have a certain nucleotide. In this case, 
67 percent of the people within this study have an A,
and 33 percent have a G (also from \cite{ahsan2017relative}, Table S3).

    a protein sequence.

    of proteins produced (not shown in figure).
    Adapted from \cite{shafee2015}
  }
  \label{fig:dna_to_protein}
\end{figure}

The second type of data are concentrations of certain proteins in the 
blood. DNA contains the code for building proteins (see Figure 
\ref{fig:dna_to_protein}), 
as well as the rate
at which a protein is created. Some proteins end up in the blood and
their presence can be used to assess the health of an individual.
IL6RA is a protein [TODO: more info]

The field of genetic epidemiology looks -among others- for
correlations between genetic data and biological traits.
For example, figure \ref{fig:ahsan2017relative_table_2_sub} (from \cite{ahsan2017relative}) shows that
SNP \verb|rs12133641| is highly correlated (p value is 3.0 * 10e-73, 
961 individuals) with protein IL6RA. What this results does
not yet teach us, is how this correlation works, yet
figure \ref{fig:ahsan2017relative_s6} shows us the direction of the association:
the X axis shows the possible genetic make-ups (aka the genotype) of the individuals,
where 0 denotes the individuals with genotype
AA (the individual inherited one adenosine 
from his/here mother and one adenosine from his/her father), 
1.0 denotes AG (one A is inherited from one parent, 
where the G is inherited from the other parent) and 2.0 denotes GG.
From Figure \ref{fig:ahsan2017relative_s6} we can conclude that, on average,
the more guanines are inherited at that SNPs location,
the higher concentration of IL6RA can be found in a human's blood.

The amount of variance that can be explained by an association (i.e.
the R squared value) is rarely 100 percent, which means that a trait (in
this case, IL6RA concentrations) cannot be perfectly explained
from the genotype alone. As we can see in figure \ref{fig:ahsan2017relative_s6}, 
43 percent of the variance can be attributed to an individuals'
genotype and additional factors, 
such as the effect
of the environment (e.g. geographic location, time of day), 
lifestyle (e.g. smoking yes/no) or having a disease (e.g. diabetes) 
are needed to explain the variation between individuals better.

    961 individuals) to the concentration of the protein IL6RA, as measured
    in blood. The table is a simplified result from \cite{ahsan2017relative}.

\section{Code is more important than the (English) paper}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{The experiments within genetic epidemology works are done by code}

The experiment described above is run by code. There is no fieldwork,
nor lab-work involved. It is the researcher that writes the code,
after which the code does the work. A genetic epidemiologist that
looks for associations between genotype and phenotype,
one does not need a lab.

To \emph{obtain} the genetic data, yes, there may be fieldwork and/or lab-work
involved. For example, a researcher needs to go into the field to take
samples (e.g. blood) of humans or other species. To analyse these samples,
a researcher needs a lab. Depending on the technique being used on
how to analyse the samples, there may be a big bioinformatics step
to aggregate the measurements into useful genetic data. 
Although this paper does not focus on the code run to 
aggragate the raw data into useful genetic data, the same arguments
can be made for that code as in the example: that code is 
the ground truth of how the raw data is collected into useful genetic data.

\paragraph{The code is the paradata for the results of an experiment}

Programming code is paradata, as it is data that describes how data is collected,
which is the definition of paradata [TODO: REF].
Programming code is data that is usually in the form of text, 
spread over one or more files, that describes the experiment.
The experiment collects the data.
The data collected is the data we call the results of an experiment.

The article is metadata, as it is data that describes other
data, which is the definition of metadata [TODO: REF]:
an article describes the
experiment and hence the programming
code in English. However, it is not the best
candidate to describe how the data is collected,
as it has a loose connection with collecting the data.
Again, if the code and article of an experiment disagree,
it is the code that actually let the data be collected.  
Instead, an article is metadata about a research.

\paragraph{Code should be published}

For science to be reproducible (a fundamental property of the scientific 
method), it is the code that should be published, instead of the
English description of what the code does (i.e. the article), if one
would have to pick one, as it is the code does the actual work.
Hence, from a knowledge management perspective, emphasis should be
put more on the preservation of code, as it is the most important actor
in an experiment.

To quote a review on reproducibility \cite{peng2021reproducible}, 
'Reproducibility is typically thwarted by a 
lack of availability of the original data and computer code'.
In the case of genetic epidemiology, it is a given that the original
data cannot be published as this data is sensitive.

\paragraph{Example of code being the ground truth}

Code should be published, as it holds the
ground truth of an experiment; it does the actual work.
The more complex the computation pipeline is, the easier it is
to have a mismatch between the article (that describes what the
code does) and the code (that actually does the work).
It is easy (tempting?) to overlook how easy it is to have a mismatch
between paper and code.

To illustrate how easy it is to get a mismatch between a paper
and the code, consider this fictional example
of a text in a paper:

\begin{verbatim}
We compared the values of x and y using a one-tailed Student's T-test,
as we expect the average value of x to be less than the average value of y.
\end{verbatim}

We ignore the choices of words and style of this sentence: what is
important is the content: a one-tailed T test is performed.
Taking a look at the (in this case, the programming language R) code, 
we find the following line:

\begin{verbatim}
t.test(x, y)
\end{verbatim}

The line of code is simplified (as the result of the T test is never stored),
but the code is correct:
\verb|t.test| is indeed the name of an R function to do a T-test
and it is reasonable to assume that this code, when found in the code
of an article, is assumed to be correct.

Here, however, we see a mismatch between the English description and the code:
by default, the R function \verb|t.test| does a \textbf{two}-tailed T-test.
A consequence of this fictional example is that the published p-values are
higher than needed, resulting in less significant findings, which
results in less conclusions drawn from a paper.

It is the paper that accompanies the code,
as it is the code that generates the results.
When humans are fallible and code gets bigger, the likelihood of
a mismatch between the English paper and the code increases.
But regardless of the size of the code, 
it is the code that is the ground truth.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{There are multiple way to publish code}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

There are multiple ways of publishing code,
that are increasingly hard to do, yet result
in more reproducible experiments:
(1) publishing the code as text only, e.g. by printing
it in a Supplementary Materials, (2) publishing
the code on a hosted website, e.g on GitHub, with
added features (3) publishing 
the installed code within a virtual environment,
for example, using a Singularity container.
Here I will go into details of each of these ways.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Publishing raw code}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Code is commonly published alongside of a 
paper, pasted as text in the Supplementary Materials 
(for example, in \cite{labrecque2019interpretation}).
This is the rawest form of publishing code,
as it is just text.

\paragraph{Raw code is important}

The raw code of a computational experiment is
more important to preserve than the article describing
the experiment, even when both describe the experiment identically,
correctly and reproducibly, 
as it has/should been that code that generated the results of an experiment.
Again: if the paper and code differ, it is the code that did
the actual work with the actual/true results.

\paragraph{Raw code is an indicator of quality}

Raw code gives an indication of the quality 
of a computational experiment and several metrics are
devised to get an idea of the quality of code.

The simplest metric to assess the quality of code is 
the amount of (single) lines of code (SLOC). 
Code that has a lower SLOC count, i.e. it is more concise,
is usually regarded as having a lower chance of containing bugs.

A more interesting metric is the cyclomatic complexity of the code.
The cyclomatic complexity is defined as the number of ways that
the code can be executed. 
For example, code that has only one \verb|if| statement
has a cyclomatic complexity of 2, as the condition within the \verb|if|
statement can be true or false.
The cyclomatic complexity correlates with code complexity,
where more complex code is likelier to contain bugs.

A feature that deserves more attention
is that code can actively teach what it does.
A mechanism to do so, which is present in most programming
languages, is error handling: errors are the mechanism
by which a programmer can teach the user what to do/expect.
One example is when calculating the variance of a distribution.
To calculate the variance of a distribution, at least two values
are required. When the variance of only one value is requested,
an error message can helpfully indicate that one needs at least two values.

\paragraph{The problems with raw code}

There are multiple problems with publishing raw code.
First, there is no guarantee that that code \emph{can} actually
run, for example, due to a typo added after the code was pasted.
Secondly, there is no way to determine if code that worked yesterday
works today. These problems can be prevented by, instead of
pasting raw code, using a website to host that code (see below).

\paragraph{Raw code is already better than no code}

Publishing raw code is already better than not publishing code at all,
as that raw code can be assumed to have run successfully at least once.
To reproduce an experiment from raw code can be painful, 
yet way better than rewriting the same code from scratch.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Publishing hosted code}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Code is sometimes published alongside a paper, 
in the form of a hosted website.
This way of publishing code gives additional options,
both for the authors of that code, as well as its users.

\paragraph{Example of hosted code}

There are multiple websites for hosting code, with GitHub,
and GitLab being the most well-known.
GitHub is the most commonly used website to host code in general,
with millions of users.
GitHub users can create dedicated websites (called 'repositories')
to upload code. GitHub hosts that uploaded by and provides
a user interface for every visiter of such a website.
An example from the author is the website \cite{bbbq_article_issue_157},
that hosts part of the code for the paper \cite{bilderbeek2022transmembrane}.

\paragraph{Hosted code has important metadata}

Hosted code has many additional features, such as
a version-controlled history, continuous integration scripts
and automatically generated metrics.

\paragraph{Hosted code has a commit history}

Hosted code commonly has a commit history. For example, GitHub
uses a version control system called \verb|git| (hence its name).
In practice, this means that when a change is made to the code,
a new version is created. In the case that the change was harmful,
one can go back to an earlier version and continue again from there.

\paragraph{A commit history helps assess honest reporting}

A commit history helps to assess the honesty 
in the reporting of the code. 
Ideally, the full version history of the code 
has been generated, by hosting the code directly at its inception.
However, in some repositories, only the final version of the code has been
posted, which means all historical information is lost.
From a code history, it can be observed, for example, 
how much statistical tests have really/actually been done 
and see if all are reported:
not reporting a statistical tests is considered a Dubious Research Practice.

\paragraph{Continuous integration helps assess code quality}

\paragraph{Metrics help assess the honest division of labour}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Publishing a virtual environment}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{Code is hard to manage}

Unlike English, code is fragile in standing the test of time.
Containers can alleviate this.
Code has a limited lifetime.

\paragraph{Runnable code has other important features}

 * Reproduce an experiment
 * Code can teach the user, see babette
 * Build upon an experiment

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The code that does the work in a computational experiment should
always be published together with a scholarly article.
For research to be reproducible, one ideally has access to
both the data used and the code.
In some fields, such as genetic epidemiology, the data is
sensitive, hence cannot be released,
yet there are methods being devised to run code on sensitive
data with assured privacy \cite{zhang2016review,azencott2018machine}.

Code has additional useful information, similar to confidence intervals,
that allow a reader to gauge how much he/she trusts the results.
The most important way to determine the quality of code
is the amount of unit tests.
When following a set of best practices, such as DevOps, TDD, Agile,
writing unit tests is an essential 
part in writing code.
The amount of unit tests is an honest signal 
for code correctness (i.e. it does what it is supposed to do, as opposed
to 'it does something').
In academia, to uncover the truth, code correctness is essential.
To make a comparison with cell biologists, where working
sterile is essential to have the correct results,
unit tests allow a computational biologist to have the same.

Code is harder to preserve than an English text.

Although code is the primary actor in computational experiments,
there is no incentive to submit code alongside a publication.
Most academic journal do not require authors to submit their code,
nor it the submitted code peer reviewed.

Although the code of computation experiments can be archived well, 
there is no incentive to do so.

Although a runnable version of a computation experiment can be archived well, 
there is no incentive to do so.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Discussion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{Definition}

Code may or may not be paradata, depending on how the definition
is interpreted.
Here we repeat the definition of 'paradata' and discuss 
its (numbered) constituents.
This paper defined paradata as 'data (1) about the collecting (2) of the data (3)',
where (1) code must be seen as data, (2) downloading raw data
and doing calculations must be seen as collecting, and (3) the
results of an experiment must be seen as data.
This paper argues, that (1) code is data in the form of text spread
over one or more files, that has useful measurable properties, 
(2) downloading raw datas and doing calculations, such as a T-test,
does describe how the bits and pieces of an end result is collected,
and (3) an experimental results is data, as it can be measured and
used as the raw data of a next experiment.

\paragraph{The drawbacks of publishing code}

Publishing code may be disadvantageous for an author.
For science, yes, as this allows reproducible research.
For an author, publishing code alongside an experiment opens up
the possibily to receive questions regarding that code.
For a publisher
For a knowledge archivist, 

\paragraph{The drawbacks of publishing version-controlled code}

Is it worth it to publish version-controlled code?
For an author, 
there is additional training involved, and also here,
publishing code alongside an experiment opens up
the possibily to receive questions regarding that code.

\paragraph{The drawbacks of publishing a running version of code}

Is it worth it to archive running versions of code?
For an author, 
there is additional training involved.
There is no FAIR infrastructure for Singularity containers.

\paragraph{Recommendations}

Being able to re-do an experiment is a core principle of the scientific method.
Publishing only a paper about a computational experiment is not enough,
as the results are too likely to mismatch that English description.
Journal should make it mandatory for authors
to publish their code alongside a computational experiment.
Authors should follow the FAIR principes for their code as well,
as can be done using the infrastructure as supplied by, 
for example, GitHub and GitLab, opening up new angles in
metascience regarding computational experiments.
Knowledge managers should create the infrastructure for the preservation
of runnable experiments, to allow scientist to upload a Singularity
container, so these are as well following the FAIR principles.

\paragraph{Final word}

The world of science would be a more open, humble, trustworthy, truthful
and helpful would the code that accompanies a scientific paper
be treated like a first class citizen. As doing so in an exemplary way
in yet to be rewarded, hence it has to be the idealististic scientists
to wage this battle. I feel the truth and science are worth fighting for
and I hope this paper helps others to join.
