# chapter_paradata

Chapter for edited volume about paradata

## Abstract

Here we define paradata as the data that describes the generation of data.
In theoretical biology, the data generated is mostly simulated,
as done by computer code.
In such context, paradata is usually the scientific paper that
describes what the computer code does.
However, this has the unrealtistic 
assumption that there is a perfect match between the paper and the code.
In this chapter it is argued that the source code should should be supplied,
as this is the true paradata: if the paper and code disagree, it is the
code that has generated the results.
The chapter concludes by some rules how to allow code to serve as paradata,
and hence allowing theoretical biology research to be truly reproducible.
