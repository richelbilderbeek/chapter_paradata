# chapter_paradata

Chapter for edited volume about paradata

## Abstract 1: theoretical computational research

 * @Lisa: I suggest this approach, as it will result in a cleaner chapter,
   but the relevance is less apparent than the second abstract
 * Data is simulated
 * Focus on theoretical biology

Here we define paradata as the data that describes the generation of data.
In theoretical computational research, the data generated is mostly simulated,
as done by computer code.
In such context, paradata is usually the scientific paper that
describes what the computer code does.
However, this has the unrealtistic 
assumption that there is a perfect match between the paper and the code.
In this chapter it is argued that the source code should should be supplied,
as this is the true paradata: if the paper and code disagree, it is the
code that has generated the results.
The chapter concludes by some rules how to allow code to serve as paradata,
and hence allowing computational research to be truly reproducible.

## Abstract 2: genetic epidemiology

 * @Lisa: you may pick this approach, as this has a more direct relevance
 * Data is the result of an analysis
 * Input (e.g. DNA sequences) is established

Here we define paradata as the data that describes the generation of data.
In genetic epidemiology, the data generated is mostly the results 
of an analysis (e.g. predicting a person having a disease),
as done by computer code.
In such context, paradata is usually the scientific paper that
describes what the computer code does.
However, this has the unrealtistic 
assumption that there is a perfect match between the paper and the code.
In this chapter it is argued that the source code should should be supplied,
as this is the true paradata: if the paper and code disagree, it is the
code that has generated the results.
The chapter concludes by some rules how to allow code to serve as paradata,
and hence allowing theoretical biology research to be truly reproducible.
