# chapter_paradata

## Abstract

Here we define paradata as the data that describes the generation of data.
In genetic epidemiology, the data generated is mostly the results 
of an analysis (e.g. predicting a person having a disease),
as done by computer code.
In such context, paradata is usually the scientific paper that
describes what the computer code does.
However, this has the unrealtistic 
assumption that there is a perfect match between the paper and the code.
In this chapter it is argued that the source code should should be supplied,
as this is the true paradata: if the paper and code disagree, it is the
code that has generated the results.
The chapter concludes by some rules how to allow code to serve as paradata,
and hence allowing theoretical biology research to be truly reproducible.

## Introduction

The currency that universities generate is knowledge, which in turn is distributed
in mostly lectures and academic papers.



Knowledge management efforts typically focus on organisational objectives such as improved performance, competitive advantage, innovation, the sharing of lessons learned, integration and continuous improvement of the organisation.

 * [ ] introduce the practical situation where paradata is relevant for the readership
   clearly enough that even readers outside your own discipline can follow the rationale
   of your writing. Remember to describe explicitly (but briefly) your disciplinary
   (scholarly and practical) and research context, research front and motivate the 
   focus of the discussion. Please also state explicitly the relevance/implications
   of the results from and for your practical case/perspective.

In addition, we would like to direct your attention to a couple of general issues. Our volume will appear in a book series that relates to knowledge management. This means that we are going to discuss the chapters in the introduction and the epilogue/conclusions from a KM perspective and KM researchers and professionals are also, in a very broad sense,  one of the major target audiences of the volume as a whole. In a very broad sense, KM encompasses different aspects relevant to the management, governance, administration, curation and facilitation of information, knowledge, data, records etc. and related processes and practises. This does not mean that you need to assume a KM perspective in the chapter BUT if there are relevant management (or similar) aspects that stem from the discussion in the chapter, you are free to make a note of them.

As an additional remark, considering the interdisciplinarity of the volume we encourage you to illustrate the point you make in your chapter using a concrete problem that exists and provide enough information on the research (and practical) context you are writing about that a person outside of your own field can follow your argument. Moreover, remember to motivate the relevance of your findings and/or conclusions again considering the interdisciplinary audience.
